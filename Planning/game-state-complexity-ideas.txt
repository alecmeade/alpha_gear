This file is meant to list ideas to address Risk's relatively high game state complexity and branching factor: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_complexity

Ideas can be categorized as to whether they will be applied to the 1) Environment, 2) Actions, 3) Rewards, 4) Agents or 5) Other

1) Environment
  a) Simplify the gameboard to an abstract 2D grid
  b) Constrain the number of territories and continents
  
2) Actions
  a) Apply heuristics to constrain possible actions prior to stochastics or agent decision making 
    i) Only attack if bordering territory troop # <= your troop #
  b) Apply automated rules for non-core actions
    i) Autotrade cards
  
3) Rewards
  a) Apply marginal rewards at intermediate time steps (e.g. + if you capture a territory, - if you lose a territory) rather than a single massive reward after winning
  
4) Other
  a) Apply Inverse Reinforcement Learning on actual human gameplay from WarGear
  b) Leverage LLMs
